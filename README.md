# ðŸ§ª The Last Drop

*A cozy, terminal-based potion-making game with a twist.*

## ðŸŒ¿ What is this?

**The Last Drop** is a small, text-based RPG where you play as an apprentice learning the gentle art of potion-making in a sleepy, magical town. The game runs in the terminal and is being built as my first solo Python project.

Expect:
- Character creation
- A 1â€“2 week in-game cycle
- Daily tasks and customers
- Simple potion crafting

## ðŸ›  Project Status

This project is brand new! I'm currently laying the groundwork.
